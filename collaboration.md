# Collaboration with git is fun and easy!

Well, that depends on your definition of easy -- [xkcd has thoughts about this](https://xkcd.com/1597/).

## My thoughts

You have to be careful when multiple people are working on the same thing, but git makes it possible to figure out the process.

But sometimes there could be conflicts in the same file.

## Your ideas
I think this is going to be tricky, but I am excited to try!

Especially until you become conceptually comfortable with versioning.

## Another person's ideas
Practice and patience make perfect!  
Do you mean multiple people working on the same time on the same time? Would there be publishing conflicts?

Make sure to save this document before staging the changes!
