# Spring 2019

## Git and GitHub
April 4, 2019

### Objectives
1. Gain familiarity with git, github, and markdown
2. Practice writing in markdown, using git with the command line and atom, and collaborating on a repository
3. Discover what else you can do with git, github, and markdown

### Tasks

#### Setting up
1. Install git
2. Create a github account
3. Slack your username to Alice so she can add you to our team
4. **Config**-ure your name and user account using the command line
5. **Clone** this repository and open it in atom

#### Publishing
1. Create a new markdown document in your local copy of the repository.
2. Open the document in atom and write content: use markdown syntax to create headings, text, and links or images. Save the document.
4. **Add** your document to git's plate so it knows you've made changes (also referred to as "staging" your changes)
5. **Commit** to the changes you've made (at least for now) and write a note about what you changed
6. **Pull** in any new changes from the cloud-based or "remote" repository (always do this before you publish your changes)
7. **Push** your changes to the remote repository

#### Collaborating
1. Open the file [collaboration.md](/collaboration.md) in Atom.
