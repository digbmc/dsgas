# Git, GitHub, and Markdown

April 4, 2019

## Objectives

1. Gain familiarity with git, github, and markdown
2. Practice writing in markdown, using git with the command line and atom, and collaborating on a repository
3. Discover what else you can do with git, github, and markdown


## Practice

For the relevant commands, see your cheatsheets for [git](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) and [markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf). If you need help, consult your peers or the [answer key](/answers.md)

### Setting up

1. Once you've made sure git is installed and set up a user account, you'll want to **Config**-ure your name and user account using the command line
2. **Clone** this repository and open it in atom
3. Create a new markdown document in your local repository.
4. Open the document in atom and write content using markdown syntax.

### Publishing

1. Make sure you've saved your new document.
2. Check the **status** of your local repository according to git.
3. **Add** your document to git's plate so it knows you've made changes (also referred to as "staging" your changes)
4. **Commit** to the changes you've made (at least for now) and write a note about what you changed
5. **Pull** in any new changes from the cloud-based or "remote" repository (always do this before you publish your changes to a shared repo)
5. **Push** your changes to the remote repository.
6. Open the remote in your browser to see what happened.

### Collaborating

1. **Pull** your teammates' changes and see what happens.
2. Open the file [collaboration.md](/collaboration.md) in Atom, make some changes, and save the file.
3. **Add** your changes and **commit** them
2. Create a new **branch** of the repository so your changes won't interfering with anyone else's work.
3. **Checkout** your new branch (switch to it).
4. **Push** your changes to your personal **branch** (you don't need to pull because nobody else should be working on this branch): git push origin [yourbranch]
5. Look at the remote in the browser and see if you can figure out where your changes went.  
6. Once you feel good about the changes you've made on your branch, you can try to **merge** it with the master branch.
